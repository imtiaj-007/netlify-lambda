# Clean Energy Backend ( Serverless )
The Electricity Bill Management System is created using the MERN stack. This is the backend code of the application. This system manages the electricity billing by providing a seamless interface for users to view, pay, and track their electricity consumption and bills.
It is powered by Node.js and Express.js for efficient data handling, while MongoDB stores user, billing, and payment information.

# Benifits of Serverless Architecture:
  - Scalability: Automatically scales with user demand, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention.
  - Cost-Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing model reduces costs by charging only for actual usage.
  - Reduced Maintenance: Eliminates the need for server management, allowing developers to focus on coding and innovation.
  - Simplified Development: Simplifies deployment processes, enabling quicker release cycles and updates.
